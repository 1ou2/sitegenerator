MARKDOWN_DIR : location for the sources articles
HTML_DIR="html" : output directory
CSS_FILE="style.css" : CSS stylesheet that will be used - must be in the assets folder 
TOP_TAGS=5 : number of tags to display
NB_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE=2 : number of articles per pages

# Articles
Articles are created in markdown format and stored in `articles` directory

# RUN
`python3 website.py`

# Development
this project is a website generator. 
- Articles are written in the articles folder using markdon format and metadata in yaml header. 
- The assets folder contains image, css. The html folder is generated by the script.
- The static folder contains static web files
- The template file contains the structure of the html files.
- articles.py : generate one article
- website.py : entry point for the program. generates the index, the pages and the articles

Currently the index page contains the full content of the articles (there is a limit in the number of articles per page). 
# TODO
Add a parameter so that i can either keep the current way of generating pages with the full content of the articles or only include the title, and the abstract of the article (the abstract is a metadata in the yaml header of my markdown article)
